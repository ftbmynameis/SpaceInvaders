Welcome to SpaceInvaders
=============================

This is a clone of the famous SpaceInvaders game which I've coded alone for a project in my second last year of school.
The game has been coded for Windows using SDL 1.2 with SDL_TTF + SDL_image as additional extensions. Therefore it should be
quite easy to be plattform independent but as it was my second "big" project I've never felt the need to do so.

The purpose of this repository is for personal references but mainly to help other beginners learn from a lean working game which has a
decent code quality as I had to submit it in school. Yet you might not consider whatever I did code there as a good coding / solution, but
I still think it'll have it's purpose.

Dependencies
=============================
The game has been coded with SDL 1.2 and SDL_TTF + SDK_image as extensions. Therefore those 3 libraries have to be included and linked. SDL is
very simple multimedia library in C and has been update to the next major version SDL 2.0. Therefore all those libraries are deprecated and I don't
recommend using SDL 1.2 anymore. For compatibility reasons I have searched for the libraries and added them to the repository. There are no library
files provided yet, I may feel the need to compile them at some point but until than you won't be able to compile this out of the box as you have
to compile the *libs for yourself first. Some DLLs for SDL_image and SDL_TTF are also missing.

Here is a link to all the used libraries, maybe you'll find what you need there!
SDL: https://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
SDL_TTF: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/release-1.2.html (note that SDL_TTF 2.0 seems to be backwards compatible with SDL_TTF 1.2)
SDL_image: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release-1.2.html

License
===============================

I don't really care at all. Use this as whatever you want. I don't take any responsibility for this code whatsoever.
Useage on your own risk. 

Images/Font
==============================
I've replaced the original images which some which have a free license, same for the font. Just a precaution to avoid trouble. I'm not sure
whos the owner of the original images and I don't wanna find out via a lawsuit.

Last but not least
